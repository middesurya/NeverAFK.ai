### Thread (Technical Deep Dive)

1/ I built an AI support tool that actually understands course content.

Not a ChatGPT wrapper. Real RAG implementation with LangGraph.

Here's how it works 🧵

2/ The Problem:
Course creators spend 6,000+ hours answering repetitive questions.

Generic chatbots fail because they don't know YOUR content.

3/ The Solution:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Upload your course → AI indexes it → Students ask questions → AI retrieves relevant content → Responds with citations

4/ Tech Stack:
• LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration
• Pinecone for vector search
• OpenAI for embeddings + LLM
• FastAPI backend
• Next.js frontend

All built in 48 hours.

5/ Key Feature: Source Citations

AI doesn't just answer—it tells students WHERE the answer came from.

"This was covered in Module 3, timestamp 14:23"

Builds trust. Students know it's legit.

6/ Early Results:
• 80% question accuracy
• <2s response time
• Students prefer it to waiting for creator
• Creators save 20+ hrs/week

7/ Try it free: [link]

Built with @LangChainAI @pinecone @OpenAI

If you're a creator drowning in support, this might help.

### r/SideProject

**Title:**
"Built an AI support tool that actually understands course content (RAG-powered)"

**Post:**

Hey r/SideProject!

I just launched Creator Support AI - an AI customer support tool specifically for course creators and digital product sellers.

**The Problem:**
Course creators spend insane amounts of time answering repetitive questions. I talked to dozens who were spending 20+ hours per week just on support. Generic chatbots don't work because they don't understand the creator's specific content.

**What I Built:**
A RAG-powered (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that:
- Indexes course materials (videos, PDFs, text)
- Automatically transcribes videos using Whisper
- Answers student questions with citations to specific modules
- Flags uncertain responses for human review
- Embeds as a widget on any website

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI + LangGraph + LangChain
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Vector DB: Pinecone
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-4
- Database: Supabase

Built the MVP in a weekend using the LangGraph framework.

**What Makes It Different:**
Unlike ChatGPT wrappers, this actually knows YOUR content. When a student asks "What did you cover in Module 3 about X?", it retrieves the exact content and cites the source.

**Try it:** [link]

Would love feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

### r/Entrepreneur

**Title:**
"How I'm helping course creators save 20+ hours/week on customer support"

**Post:**

Course creators have a support problem that's costing them time and money.

**The Numbers:**
- Average course creator: 6,000+ manual responses before automation
- Support overwhelm: Top-3 operational bottleneck
- 71% of customers expect fast responses
- Creators can't scale themselves

**The Solution:**
I built Creator Support AI - an AI that actually reads course content and answers student questions automatically.

**How It Works:**
1. Creator uploads course materials (videos, PDFs, text)
2. AI indexes everything using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
3. Students ask questions via chat widget
4. AI responds with citations to specific modules
5. Creator reviews conversations and improves accuracy

**Early Traction:**
- 80% of questions answered accurately
- 20+ hours/week saved per creator
- Students prefer instant answers to waiting

**Business Model:**
- Free: 100 responses/month
- Starter: $29/month (1,000 responses)
- Pro: $49/month (unlimited)

This isn't another ChatGPT wrapper. It's a specialized tool solving a $60B problem in the creator economy.

**First Comment (Post After Launch):**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of Creator Support AI.

**Why I Built This:**

I talked to 50+ course creators who were spending 20+ hours per week answering repetitive questions. Existing chatbots didn't work because they couldn't answer content-specific questions like "What did you cover in Module 3 about X?"

So I built a RAG system that actually indexes their course materials and responds with citations.

**How It Works:**

The magic is in the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
1. Upload course content
2. System chunks and embeds everything in Pinecone
3. Student asks question
4. Vector search finds relevant content
5. LLM generates response with citations
6. Creator reviews and refines

**What's Different:**

Most "AI support" tools are just ChatGPT wrappers. This actually knows YOUR content—videos, PDFs, transcripts—and cites specific sources.

**Try It:**

Free tier gives you 100 responses to test it out. No credit card needed.

Questions? Fire away! Happy to talk about the tech, business model, or creator market.
