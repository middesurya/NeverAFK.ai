Module 1: Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to Introduction to Python Programming! This module covers the fundamentals of Python, one of the most popular programming languages today.

What You'll Learn:
- Python syntax and basic concepts
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modules
- File handling basics

Lesson 1.1: Getting Started

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity.

To install Python:
1. Visit python.org
2. Download Python 3.10 or higher
3. Run the installer
4. Verify installation: python --version

Your First Program:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Lesson 1.2: Variables and Data Types

Variables store data. In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.

Examples:
```python
# Numbers
age = 25
price = 19.99

# Strings
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello, Python!'

# Booleans
is_student = True
has_graduated = False
```

Data Types:
- int: Whole numbers (42, -10, 0)
- float: Decimal numbers (3.14, -0.5)
- str: Text ("hello", 'world')
- bool: True or False
- list: Ordered collection [1, 2, 3]
- dict: Key-value pairs {"name": "Alice"}

Lesson 1.3: Control Flow

If Statements:
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("Too young to vote")
```

Loops:
```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Lesson 1.4: Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

Functions with multiple parameters:
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width

area = calculate_area(5, 3)
print(area)  # Outputs: 15
```

Assignment 1:
Create a program that:
1. Asks for user's name
2. Asks for user's age
3. Prints a personalized greeting
4. Uses if/else to determine if they're an adult

Common Questions:

Q: Do I need prior programming experience?
A: No! This course assumes no prior knowledge.

Q: What's the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?
A: Python 2 is outdated. Use Python 3 (3.10+).

Q: How long does this module take?
A: Most students complete it in 4-6 hours.

Q: Where can I practice?
A: Use the practice exercises in the Resources section.

Module Summary:
- Python is easy to learn and powerful
- Variables store data without explicit type declarations
- Control flow uses if/else and loops
- Functions make code reusable
- Practice is essential for mastery

Next Steps:
After completing this module, proceed to Module 2: Data Structures and Algorithms.
