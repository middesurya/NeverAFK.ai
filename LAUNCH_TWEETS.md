Not a ChatGPT wrapper. Real RAG implementation.

### Tweet 2
```
The problem: Course creators spend 20+ hours/week answering the same questions.

Generic chatbots fail because they don't know YOUR content.

Solution: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Upload your course materials. AI indexes everything. Students get instant answers with source citations.
```

### Tweet 3
```
Tech stack for the nerds:

- LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration
- Pinecone for vector search
- OpenAI GPT-4 for responses
- FastAPI backend
- Next.js 15 + React 19 frontend
- Supabase for data persistence
- Deployed on Railway + Vercel
```

### Tweet 4
```
Key feature: Source Citations

The AI doesn't just answer - it tells students WHERE the answer came from.

"This was covered in Module 3, AI-Powered Support section"

Builds trust. Students know it's legit. Creators can verify accuracy.
```

### Tweet 5

## Reddit Post (r/SideProject)

**Title:** I built an AI support agent that actually reads your course content (RAG-powered)

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey r/SideProject!

Just shipped Creator Support AI - an AI customer support tool for course creators.

**The Problem:**
Course creators spend 20+ hours/week answering repetitive questions. Generic chatbots don't work because they don't understand specific course content.

**What I Built:**
A RAG-powered system that:
- Indexes course videos, PDFs, and text
- Answers student questions with citations
- Shows which module/section the answer came from
- Flags uncertain responses for human review

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI + LangGraph + LangChain
- Frontend: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind
- Vector DB: Pinecone
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-4
- Database: Supabase
- Hosting: Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

**Live Demo:** https://never-afk-ai-lngm.vercel.app/demo

Would love feedback! What features would make this more useful?

## Posting Strategy

1. **Twitter:** Post main thread in the morning (9-11am your timezone)
2. **Reddit:** Post to r/SideProject 2-3 hours after Twitter
3. **LinkedIn:** Post same day, evening time
4. **Reply to all comments** within 2 hours of posting
5. **Retweet/share** your own post 8 hours later with "Still blown away by the response..."

---

## Notes

- Always attach the demo GIF (`neverafk-ai-demo.gif`)
- Link to the demo page, not the landing page (lower friction)
- Respond to EVERY comment/reply
- Ask for feedback to drive engagement
- Don't oversell - let the demo speak for itself
