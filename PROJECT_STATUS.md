## What's NOT Included

### Intentionally Excluded (Can Be Added Later)

❌ **Authentication System**
- Reason: Supabase Auth is documented but not implemented
- Impact: Users can use without login for MVP
- Timeline: Add in v1.1.0

❌ **Payment Processing**
- Reason: Lemon Squeezy integration coded but not tested with real payments
- Impact: Can launch with free tier only
- Timeline: Connect before monetizing

❌ **Mobile App**
- Reason: Web app is mobile-responsive
- Impact: Good mobile experience via browser
- Timeline: Native app in v1.2.0

❌ **Multi-language Support**
- Reason: MVP focuses on English
- Impact: Limited to English-speaking users
- Timeline: Add in v1.1.0

❌ **Voice/Video Responses**
- Reason: Text-based is faster to build
- Impact: Text-only responses
- Timeline: Add in v1.2.0

❌ **Advanced Analytics**
- Reason: Basic analytics included
- Impact: Limited insights for creators
- Timeline: Enhanced dashboard in v1.1.0
